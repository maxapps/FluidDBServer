FluidDBServer
=============
Adobe AIR specific AS3 library for communicating with the fantastic FluidDB API
(http://www.fluidinfo.com/fluiddb).

Unfortunately, AIR is required because of a need to to set specific request 
headers and to view response headers. I could find no straight forward way of 
doing this from vanilla flash. The JS libraries manage it by utilizing jQuery. 
An inspection of which would probably lead to a valid method.


Changes
=======
June 22, 2010	-	Minor changes to autodoc remarks.
							- Added FluidDBExplorer for experimentation and demos.


FluidDBExplorer
===============
An AIR application for demonstrating the use of this library or for just 
exploring use of the FluidDB API is now available from the Downloads page. 
Installation is the same as for any AIR application. After installation, 
run the app then view information available on the "Getting Started" tab.


Dependencies
============
Requires the as3corelib library for easily encoding/decoding JSON 
(http://code.google.com/p/as3corelib/).


Usage
=====
Include the library source code in your project's libs folder or include the 
compiled .swc in your project's Flex Build Path.


Notes
=====
This library implements the entire FluidDB API as of version 20100109. I will 
try to keep it updated as the FluidDB API matures but there are no guarantees. 


ToDo
====
I still plan to add some additional helper methods for things like 
automatically creating tags if they don't already exist when tagging an object.
