FluidDBServer
=============
Adobe AIR specific AS3 library for communicating with the fantastic FluidDB API
(http://www.fluidinfo.com/fluiddb).

Unfortunately, AIR is required because of a need to to set specific request 
headers and to view response headers. I could find no straight forward way of 
doing this from vanilla flash. The JS libraries manage it by utilizing jQuery. 
An inspection of which would probably lead to a valid method.


Dependencies
============
Requires the as3corelib library for easily encoding/decoding JSON 
(http://code.google.com/p/as3corelib/).


Usage
=====
Include the library source code in your project's libs folder or include the 
compiled .swc in your project's Flex Build Path.


Notes
=====
This library implements the entire FluidDB API as of version 20100109. I will 
try to keep it updated as the FluidDB API matures but there are no guarantees. 


ToDo
====
I plan to add some additional helper methods for things like automatically 
creating tags if they don't already exist when tagging an object, etc.

A complete working example of using the library is coming soon. The one I used 
for testing is far too ugly to release.
